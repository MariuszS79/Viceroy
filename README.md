Old Polish C64 text strategy game written with Python. You can see it working here: https://repl.it/@MariuszS2/Viceroy#main.py 
Enjoy playing and good luck ;-)
.exe works only on Windows.

Polish version of game is here: https://repl.it/@MariuszS2/Namiestnik#main.py
I also attached screens of original game and code from C64.
